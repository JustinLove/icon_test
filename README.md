# Icon Test

Test number of usable strategic icons.

Set the minimum number icons in game settings. Changing the value in-game should work. No extra images are provided and they will appear broken if viewed - valid standard icons become black boxes when it's over the limit.

On OSX with Intel HD5000 I can get 315 icons before they go black. I can go over, lower the amount, and the icons will return.
